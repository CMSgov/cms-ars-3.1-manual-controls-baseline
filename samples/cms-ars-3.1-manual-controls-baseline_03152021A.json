Examine document changes, document revision records,\nafter-action reports, etc., to ensure reviews were conducted.Interview:\nOrganizational personnel with access control responsibilities. Verify that\npersonnel: 1. Confirm their respective roles with Access Control policy; 2.\nKnow of and understand Access Control policy and procedures; and 3.

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,\nExecutive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.\nSecurity program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the\nneed for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be\nincluded as part of the general information security policy for organizations\nor, conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex\nnature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the\nsecurity program in general and for information systems, if needed. The\norganizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy\nand procedures.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include\nPHI):\n\n    Access Control policies and procedures form the foundation that allows\nprivacy protections to be implemented for the identified uses of personally\nidentifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI). Privacy\nrequirements commonly use the terms 'adequate security'\nand 'confidentiality' when referring to access controls\nand other security safeguards for PII. Applied together, these terms signify\nthe need to make risk-based decisions based on the magnitude of harm (to both\norganizations and individuals) when determining applicable restrictions for\nPII. For this overlay, refer to the definitions of 'adequate\nsecurity' in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, and\n'confidentiality' in NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 1, Appendix B.\nThese definitions are consistent with Committee for National Security Systems\nInstruction (CNSSI) No. 4009.\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag nist: ['AC-1']\n  tag nist_family: 'Access Control'\n  tag cms_ars_type: 'Mandatory'\n  tag cms_ars_baseline: ['High', 'Moderate', 'Low']\n  tag cms_ars_assurance: 'Assurance'\n  tag cms_ars_priority: 'P1'\n  tag cms_ars_reference_policy: \" Code: 5 United States Code (U.S.C.)\n§552a(b), (e)(9)-(10); FedRAMP Rev. 4 Baseline; FISCAM: AS-1, SM-1,\nSM-3; HIPAA: 45 C.F.R. §164.308(a)(3)(i); 45 C.F.R.\n§164.308(a)(3)(ii)(A); 45 C.F.R. §164.308(a)(4)(i); 45 C.F.R.\n§164.308(a)(4)(ii)(B); 45 C.F.R. §164.308(a)(4)(ii)(C); 45 C.F.R.\n§164.312(a)(1); 45 C.F.R. §164.514(d)(1)-(5); NIST SP: 800-12,\n800-37 Rev. 1 Appendix B, 800-100, 800-122; OMB Memo: M-06-16, M-17-12, Att. 4;\nOMB Circular A-130: 7.g. and Appendix III\"\n  tag related_controls: ['PM-9', 'AR-4', 'AR-7']\n\n  describe \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\" do\n    skip \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\"\n  end\nend","source_location":{"line":3,"ref":"cms-ars-3.1-manual-controls-baseline-main/controls/CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-01.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[{"status":"skipped","code_desc":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","run_time":1.35e-05,"start_time":"2021-03-15T16:27:06-04:00","resource":"","skip_message":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","resource_class":"Object","resource_params":"[]"}],"attestation":{"control_id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-01","explanation":"(Sample text) Examined ARS 3.1 IS2P2 and HHS parent Access Control policy documents and interviewed staff to confirm that these are still applicable understood and applied to our system.","frequency":"annually","status":"passed","updated":"2020-03-01","updated_by":"(sample)John Doe, ISSO"}},{"id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-02(01)","title":"Automated Information System Account Management ","desc":"Control:\n    The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of\ninformation system accounts.","descriptions":[{"label":"default","data":"Control:\n    The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of\ninformation system accounts."},{"label":"check","data":"Assessment Objective:\n    Determine if the organization has implemented all elements of this control\nas described in the control statements and implementation standard(s).\n\n    Assessment Methods and Objects:\n    Examine: System security plan; procedures addressing account management;\ninformation system design documentation; information system configuration\nsettings and associated documentation; and other relevant documents or\nrecords.Examine: Information system demonstrates automated mechanisms are used\nto support the management of information system accounts.

Some of the account management requirements listed can\nbe implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of\nauthorized users of the information system and the specification of access\nprivileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security\nplan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts\nreceive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g.,\nsystem owner, mission/business owner, or CISO) responsible for approving such\naccounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access\nprivileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination\nof both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example,\nrestrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining\nother account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements\n(e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business\nrequirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote\naccess to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could\naffect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are\naccounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary\naccounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need\nfor short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.\nOrganizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and\nwith the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account\nactivation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and\ntemporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts\n(e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or\nwhen network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are\nnot subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling\nor deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group,\nemergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when\nindividuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system\naccounts may require specialized training. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the\nlist of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and\nunedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon\ntheir request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within\na timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other\nsafeguards required by the ARS.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include\nPHI):\n\n    Account management is a critical function for developing and implementing\nan access control framework that is appropriate for the information contained\nin systems and applications. When implemented effectively, the access control\nframework provides the necessary constructs for controlling access to PII,\nlimiting disclosure of records about individuals to only those system and\napplication users that have a need for the information to perform their job\nfunctions. The purpose of this guidance is to establish requirements for user\naccess to PHI and PII.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\n    The identification of authorized users and access privileges include\nconsiderations of whether the user will need access to PHI and whether such\naccess may be permitted or required under HIPAA.

Failure to consider these factors could\naffect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are\naccounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary\naccounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need\nfor short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.\nOrganizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and\nwith the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account\nactivation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and\ntemporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts\n(e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or\nwhen network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are\nnot subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling\nor deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group,\nemergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when\nindividuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system\naccounts may require specialized training. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the\nlist of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and\nunedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon\ntheir request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within\na timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other\nsafeguards required by the ARS.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include\nPHI):\n\n    Account management is a critical function for developing and implementing\nan access control framework that is appropriate for the information contained\nin systems and applications. When implemented effectively, the access control\nframework provides the necessary constructs for controlling access to PII,\nlimiting disclosure of records about individuals to only those system and\napplication users that have a need for the information to perform their job\nfunctions. The purpose of this guidance is to establish requirements for user\naccess to PHI and PII.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\n    The identification of authorized users and access privileges include\nconsiderations of whether the user will need access to PHI and whether such\naccess may be permitted or required under HIPAA. The purpose of this guidance\nis to establish requirements for user access to PHI. Organizations should\nestablish procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health\ninformation, to include during an emergency.\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag nist: ['AC-2']\n  tag nist_family: 'Access Control'\n  tag cms_ars_type: 'Mandatory'\n  tag cms_ars_baseline: ['High', 'Moderate', 'Low']\n  tag cms_ars_assurance: nil\n  tag cms_ars_priority: 'P1'\n  tag cms_ars_reference_policy: \" Code: 5 U.S.C. §552a(b), (e)(9)-(10);\nFedRAMP Rev. 4 Baseline; FISCAM: AC-3, AS-2; HIPAA: 45 C.F.R.\n§164.308(a)(4)(i); 45 C.F.R. §164.308(a)(4)(ii)(C); 45 C.F.R.\n§164.308(a)(5)(ii)(C); 45 C.F.R. §164.312(a)(2)(i); 45 C.F.R.\n§164.502; OMB Memo: M-17-12 Att. 1, M-16-04;\"\n  tag related_controls: ['AC-3', 'AC-4', 'AC-5', 'AC-6', 'AC-10', 'AC-16',\n'AC-17', 'AC-19', 'AC-20', 'AU-9', 'CM-5', 'CM-6', 'CM-11', 'IA-2', 'IA-4',\n'IA-5', 'IA-8', 'MA-3', 'MA-4', 'MA-5', 'PL-4', 'SC-13']\n\n  describe \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\" do\n    skip \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\"\n  end\nend\n","source_location":{"line":3,"ref":"cms-ars-3.1-manual-controls-baseline-main/controls/CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-02.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[{"status":"skipped","code_desc":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","run_time":3.6e-06,"start_time":"2021-03-15T16:27:06-04:00","resource":"","skip_message":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","resource_class":"Object","resource_params":"[]"}],"attestation":{"control_id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-02","explanation":"","frequency":"daily","status":"passed","updated":"2021-01-01","updated_by":""}},{"id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-03(09)","title":"Non-Mandatory: Controlled Release ","desc":"Control:\n    The information system does not release information outside of the\nestablished system boundary unless:a.

Internal data structures can represent\ndifferent types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also\nknown as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or\nprocesses acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as\nobjects, are typically associated with data structures such as records,\nbuffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security\nattributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic\nproperties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to\nsafeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active\nentities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive\ninformation, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the\ninformation system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive\nentities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association\nof security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is\ntypically inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type.\nSecurity attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement of\ninformation security policies for access control and information flow control,\neither through organizational processes or information system functions or\nmechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly\naffect the ability of individuals to access organizational\ninformation.Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for\nselected information systems to support missions/business functions. There is\npotentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security\nattribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or\nNOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute\nranges and values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values\nare meaningful and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the\nassociation of security attributes with subjects and objects represented by\ninternal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable\ninformation system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security\nlabels include, for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection\n(i.e., encryption and data expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor,\nand classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance\nrequirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security\nattributes with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational\nprocess-based enforcement of information security policies. The AC-16 control\nrepresents the requirement for user-based attribute association (marking). The\ncontrol enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements, including\ninformation system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes\ninclude, for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access\nauthorization) level for subjects. An example of a value for both attribute\ntypes is Top Secret.Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of currently\ndefined security attributes, values, and ranges.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include\nPHI):\n\n    Implementation of this control provides a technical means to enforce\nsecurity and privacy policies, e.g., access controls and encryption. Parameter\nvalues specified by the Privacy Overlays for this control include meta-data\nthat supports privacy.Using the security attributes listed in this\ncontrol's parameter values section enables cross system\nfunctionality and reciprocity through consistent security attribute\ninterpretation. This control supports privacy protections by assigning security\nattributes that characterize information, devices, or processes (i.e., an\n'object') as containing PII or associate an\norganization's mandatory security/privacy training requirement with\na user (i.e., a 'subject') of an information system\ncontaining PII. The terms 'Subject' and\n'Object' are defined in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4, Appendix\nB, Glossary. Security attributes are meta-data about either a subject or an\nobject.

Internal data structures can represent\ndifferent types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also\nknown as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or\nprocesses acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as\nobjects, are typically associated with data structures such as records,\nbuffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security\nattributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic\nproperties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to\nsafeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active\nentities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive\ninformation, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the\ninformation system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive\nentities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association\nof security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is\ntypically inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type.\nSecurity attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement of\ninformation security policies for access control and information flow control,\neither through organizational processes or information system functions or\nmechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly\naffect the ability of individuals to access organizational\ninformation.Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for\nselected information systems to support missions/business functions. There is\npotentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security\nattribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or\nNOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute\nranges and values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values\nare meaningful and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the\nassociation of security attributes with subjects and objects represented by\ninternal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable\ninformation system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security\nlabels include, for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection\n(i.e., encryption and data expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor,\nand classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance\nrequirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security\nattributes with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational\nprocess-based enforcement of information security policies. The AC-16 control\nrepresents the requirement for user-based attribute association (marking). The\ncontrol enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements, including\ninformation system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes\ninclude, for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access\nauthorization) level for subjects. An example of a value for both attribute\ntypes is Top Secret.Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of currently\ndefined security attributes, values, and ranges.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include\nPHI):\n\n    Implementation of this control provides a technical means to enforce\nsecurity and privacy policies, e.g., access controls and encryption. Parameter\nvalues specified by the Privacy Overlays for this control include meta-data\nthat supports privacy.Using the security attributes listed in this\ncontrol's parameter values section enables cross system\nfunctionality and reciprocity through consistent security attribute\ninterpretation. This control supports privacy protections by assigning security\nattributes that characterize information, devices, or processes (i.e., an\n'object') as containing PII or associate an\norganization's mandatory security/privacy training requirement with\na user (i.e., a 'subject') of an information system\ncontaining PII. The terms 'Subject' and\n'Object' are defined in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4, Appendix\nB, Glossary. Security attributes are meta-data about either a subject or an\nobject. Other security attributes may exist for other requirements beyond\nprivacy. If an organization creates security attributes it should be cognizant\nof the risk associated with including PII in that meta-data. However, PII is\nnot included in the security attributes for the parameter values specified\nbelow.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\n    The parameter values for PHI enable policies, procedures, and data\nclassification schemas that specify the application of administrative,\ntechnical, physical controls of a specific workstation or class of workstation\nthat maintains electronic PHI.\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag nist: ['AC-16']\n  tag nist_family: 'Access Control'\n  tag cms_ars_type: 'Non-Mandatory'\n  tag cms_ars_baseline: []\n  tag cms_ars_assurance: nil\n  tag cms_ars_priority: 'P3'\n  tag cms_ars_reference_policy: \" Code: 5 U.S.C. §552a(b), (e)(9)-(10);\nFISCAM: AC-4, AS-2;

This security control implements\nprotections for PII contained on any mobile device not owned by the\norganization, including personal mobile devices, commonly referred to as\nBYOD.The organization should include in its mobile strategy a method to ensure\nboth the device's access to PII can be revoked and the\ndevice's PII contents can be remotely removed.\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag nist: ['AC-20(03)']\n  tag nist_family: 'Access Control'\n  tag cms_ars_type: 'Non-Mandatory'\n  tag cms_ars_baseline: []\n  tag cms_ars_assurance: nil\n  tag cms_ars_priority: 'P3'\n  tag cms_ars_reference_policy: \" Code: 5 U.S.C. §552a(e)(10); HHS: IS2P\n2014; OMB Memo: M-17-12, M-06-16\"\n  tag related_controls: ['AC-19(5)']\n\n  describe \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\" do\n    skip \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\"\n  end\nend\n","source_location":{"line":3,"ref":"cms-ars-3.1-manual-controls-baseline-main/controls/CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-20(03).rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[{"status":"skipped","code_desc":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","run_time":5.4e-06,"start_time":"2021-03-15T16:27:06-04:00","resource":"","skip_message":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","resource_class":"Object","resource_params":"[]"}],"attestation":{"control_id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-20(03)","explanation":"","frequency":"daily","status":"passed","updated":"2021-01-01","updated_by":""}},{"id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-20","title":"Use of External Information Systems ","desc":"Control:\n    The organization prohibits the use of external information systems,\nincluding but not limited to, Internet kiosks, personal desktop computers,\nlaptops, tablet personal computers, personal digital assistant (PDA) devices,\ncellular telephones, facsimile machines, and equipment available in hotels or\nairports to store, access, transmit, or process sensitive information, unless\nexplicitly authorized, in writing, by the CIO or his/her designated\nrepresentative.

The term\n'PIA' may refer to the process of conducting such an\nassessment, or the document produced as a result of that assessment. A PIA-like\nprocess benefits an organization and the individuals whose PII is in the\ninformation system by enabling the organization to identify, evaluate, and\nmanage the privacy risks for the PII in that system.Organizational privacy risk\nmanagement processes operate across the life cycles of all mission/business\nprocesses that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The tools and\nprocesses for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and\nresources. Such tools include, but are not limited to, conducting PIAs. OMB\nMemorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations for implementing the\nprivacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on the\ntiming for developing PIAs for information systems and electronic collections\nof information. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to extend\n the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting\nprivacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to\nidentify privacy risks and identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are\nalso conducted to ensure that programs or information systems comply with\nlegal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as notice to the\npublic of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring\ninformation systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use,\nmaintain, or share PII and are updated when changes create new privacy\nrisks.Information system privacy risk management processes operate across the\nlife cycle of an information system collecting, using, maintaining, and/or\ndisseminating PII. Such privacy risk management processes include, but are not\nlimited to, design requirements, privacy threshold analysis, privacy impact\nassessments (PIA), and implementation of secure disposition. While Section 208\nof the E-Government Act does not require — or prohibit —\na PIA for a national security system (NSS), as defined at 40 U.S.C.\n§11103 (see Section 202(i) of the E-Government Act), an organization may\nbenefit from conducting a PIA or similar privacy risk evaluation on NSS as part\nof their internal risk management process to ensure privacy risks are\nidentified, evaluated, and managed in information systems containing PII.

The term\n'PIA' may refer to the process of conducting such an\nassessment, or the document produced as a result of that assessment. A PIA-like\nprocess benefits an organization and the individuals whose PII is in the\ninformation system by enabling the organization to identify, evaluate, and\nmanage the privacy risks for the PII in that system.Organizational privacy risk\nmanagement processes operate across the life cycles of all mission/business\nprocesses that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The tools and\nprocesses for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and\nresources. Such tools include, but are not limited to, conducting PIAs. OMB\nMemorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations for implementing the\nprivacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on the\ntiming for developing PIAs for information systems and electronic collections\nof information. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to extend\n the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting\nprivacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to\nidentify privacy risks and identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are\nalso conducted to ensure that programs or information systems comply with\nlegal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as notice to the\npublic of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring\ninformation systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use,\nmaintain, or share PII and are updated when changes create new privacy\nrisks.Information system privacy risk management processes operate across the\nlife cycle of an information system collecting, using, maintaining, and/or\ndisseminating PII. Such privacy risk management processes include, but are not\nlimited to, design requirements, privacy threshold analysis, privacy impact\nassessments (PIA), and implementation of secure disposition. While Section 208\nof the E-Government Act does not require \\xE2\\x80\\x94 or prohibit \\xE2\\x80\\x94\na PIA for a national security system (NSS), as defined at 40 U.S.C.\n§11103 (see Section 202(i) of the E-Government Act), an organization may\nbenefit from conducting a PIA or similar privacy risk evaluation on NSS as part\nof their internal risk management process to ensure privacy risks are\nidentified, evaluated, and managed in information systems containing PII.

The Senior Official\nfor Privacy (SOP) coordinates monitoring and auditing efforts with information\nsecurity officials and ensures that the results are provided to senior managers\nand oversight officials.Where security and privacy controls align, to achieve\nthe most efficient and effective implementation, the CMS SOP/CPO and CIO or\nCISO should coordinate to develop a single organizational process to conduct\naudit and monitoring.\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag nist: ['AR-4']\n  tag nist_family: 'Accountability, Audit, and Risk Management'\n  tag cms_ars_type: 'Mandatory'\n  tag cms_ars_baseline: ['High', 'Moderate', 'Low']\n  tag cms_ars_assurance: nil\n  tag cms_ars_priority: 'P1'\n  tag cms_ars_reference_policy: \" Code: 44 U.S.C.: §3541; E-Gov:\n§208; OMB Memo: M-03-22, M-05-08, M-06-16, M-17-12; OMB Circular A-130;\nPrivacy Act: §552a; 45 C.F.R. §164.530(a)(1)(ii)\"\n  tag related_controls: ['AR-6', 'AR-7', 'AU-1', 'AU-2', 'AU-3', 'AU-6',\n'AU-12', 'CA-7', 'TR-1', 'UL-2']\n\n  describe \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\" do\n    skip \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\"\n  end\nend\n","source_location":{"line":3,"ref":"cms-ars-3.1-manual-controls-baseline-main/controls/CMS-ARS-3.1-AR-04.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[{"status":"skipped","code_desc":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","run_time":4.2e-06,"start_time":"2021-03-15T16:27:06-04:00","resource":"","skip_message":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","resource_class":"Object","resource_params":"[]"}],"attestation":{"control_id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-AR-04","explanation":"","frequency":"daily","status":"passed","updated":"2021-01-01","updated_by":""}},{"id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-AR-05","title":"Privacy Awareness and Training ","desc":"Control:\n    The organization: a.

One simple example, which many organizations have already\nimplemented, is TR-1, 'Privacy Notice.' This concept is\none part of the most commonly recognized approaches to 'building\nprivacy in,' which is sometimes also known as 'Privacy by\nDesign.' Privacy by Design is an internationally accepted privacy\nbest practice endorsed by the Federal Trade Commission in their March 2012\nFinal Report, 'Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid\nChange: Recommendations for Businesses and Policymakers,' and\nembodies the same principles of the Privacy Act and Section 208 of the\nE-Government Act requiring privacy protections and safeguards before\nestablishing or operating a system that may contain PII. Privacy by Design\ncalls for considering privacy risks in the design and management of information\nsystems. In addition to building in security and privacy controls discussed\nthroughout the ARS, this control considers additional privacy-specific system\ncharacteristics and controls that must be built into the system to address\nprivacy risks.To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information\nsystems, organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that\nautomate privacy controls on the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of\npersonally identifiable information (PII).

One simple example, which many organizations have already\nimplemented, is TR-1, 'Privacy Notice.' This concept is\none part of the most commonly recognized approaches to 'building\nprivacy in,' which is sometimes also known as 'Privacy by\nDesign.' Privacy by Design is an internationally accepted privacy\nbest practice endorsed by the Federal Trade Commission in their March 2012\nFinal Report, 'Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid\nChange: Recommendations for Businesses and Policymakers,' and\nembodies the same principles of the Privacy Act and Section 208 of the\nE-Government Act requiring privacy protections and safeguards before\nestablishing or operating a system that may contain PII. Privacy by Design\ncalls for considering privacy risks in the design and management of information\nsystems. In addition to building in security and privacy controls discussed\nthroughout the ARS, this control considers additional privacy-specific system\ncharacteristics and controls that must be built into the system to address\nprivacy risks.To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information\nsystems, organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that\nautomate privacy controls on the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of\npersonally identifiable information (PII). By building privacy controls into\nsystem design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII,\nthereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other\nprivacy-related incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of\nsystems to determine the need for updates to maintain compliance with the\nPrivacy Act and the organization's privacy policy. Regardless of\nwhether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly\nmonitor information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the\nuse/sharing is consistent with the authorized purposes identified in the\nPrivacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in a manner\ncompatible with those purposes.Additional guidance on privacy-enhanced design\nand development may be found in the HHS Enterprise Performance Lifecycle\n(EPLC). Regardless of the systems engineering lifecycle used, privacy\nrequirements should be considered during system design and development and\nvalidated and verified along with other system requirements.

Through the employment of\ncomprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained\nin authorization packages (i.e., security plans, security assessment reports,\nand plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing\nthe CMS CIO and information system owners with an up-to-date status of the\nsecurity state of organizational information systems and environments of\noperation. To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, the\nCMS CIO uses results of the continuous monitoring processes to the maximum\nextent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include\nPHI):\n\n    One of the considerations for the 'go/no go' decision\nwhen authorizing (or re-authorizing) an information system is whether\napplicable privacy requirements have been met.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\n    The senior-level executive should be one of the following: HIPAA Security\nOfficer, Authorizing Official, Program Manager, Information System Security\nManager (ISSM), or Information System Security Officer (ISSO).\n\n    Guidance for systems defined as CSPs:\n\n    Significant change is defined in NIST SP 800-37 Revision 1, Appendix F.

To obtain consent, organizations provide individuals\nappropriate notice of the purposes of the PII collection or technology use and\na means for individuals to consent to the activity. Organizations tailor the\npublic notice and consent mechanisms to meet operational needs. Organizations\nachieve awareness and consent, for example, through updated public\nnotices.Organizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied\nconsent. Opt-in consent is the preferred method, but it is not always feasible.\nOpt-in requires that individuals take affirmative action to allow organizations\nto collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an individual to\nclick a radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In\ncontrast, opt-out requires individuals to act to prevent the new or continued\ncollection or use of such PII. For example, the Federal Trade\nCommission's Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals to opt-out of\nreceiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by requesting to be added to a list.\nImplied consent is the least preferred method and should be used only in\nlimited circumstances.

This test will require close coordination with the\nBusiness Owner to determine specifics. 'Consent' refers\nto providing individuals the opportunity to give permission regarding how the\nagency collects, uses, and discloses their PII, including the decision whether\nto provide PII when practicable.

To obtain consent, organizations provide individuals\nappropriate notice of the purposes of the PII collection or technology use and\na means for individuals to consent to the activity. Organizations tailor the\npublic notice and consent mechanisms to meet operational needs. Organizations\nachieve awareness and consent, for example, through updated public\nnotices.Organizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied\nconsent. Opt-in consent is the preferred method, but it is not always feasible.\nOpt-in requires that individuals take affirmative action to allow organizations\nto collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an individual to\nclick a radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In\ncontrast, opt-out requires individuals to act to prevent the new or continued\ncollection or use of such PII. For example, the Federal Trade\nCommission's Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals to opt-out of\nreceiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by requesting to be added to a list.\nImplied consent is the least preferred method and should be used only in\nlimited circumstances. Implied consent occurs where individuals'\nbehavior or failure to object indicates agreement with the collection or use of\nPII (e.g., by entering and remaining in a building where notice has been posted\nthat security cameras are in use, the individual implies consent to the video\nrecording).

Effective redress processes demonstrate\norganizational commitment to data quality especially in those business\nfunctions where inaccurate data may result in inappropriate decisions or denial\nof benefits and services to individuals. Organizations use discretion in\ndetermining if records are to be corrected or amended, based on the scope of\nredress requests, the changes sought, and the impact of the changes.\nIndividuals may appeal an adverse decision and have incorrect, incomplete, or\nout-of-date information amended, where appropriate.To provide effective\nredress, organizations: (i) provide effective notice of the existence of a PII\ncollection; (ii) provide plain language explanations of the processes and\nmechanisms for requesting access to records; (iii) establish criteria for\nsubmitting requests for correction or amendment; (iv) implement resources to\nanalyze and adjudicate requests; (v) implement means of correcting or amending\ndata collections; and (vi) review any decisions that may have been the result\nof inaccurate information.Organizational redress processes provide responses to\nindividuals of decisions to deny requests for correction or amendment,\nincluding the reasons for those decisions, a means to record individual\nobjections to the organizational decisions, and a means of requesting\norganizational reviews of the initial determinations. Where PII is corrected,\nor amended, organizations take steps to ensure that all authorized recipients\nof that PII are informed of the corrected or amended information.

Individuals\n(e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access\nauthorization credentials are not considered visitors. Authorization\ncredentials include, for example, badges, identification cards, and smart\ncards.

Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security\ncontrol baselines in NIST 800-53 Appendix D and Committee on National Security\nSystems (CNSS) Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or\nto address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of\noperation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal\nIdentity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). NIST 800-53\nAppendix I provides guidance on developing overlays.Security plans need not be\nsingle documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents, including\ndocuments that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of\nreferences to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and\nimplementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained.\nThis reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs\nand maintains security-related information in other established\nmanagement/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system\ndevelopment life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For example,\nsecurity plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response\nplan information but instead provide explicitly or by reference sufficient\ninformation to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.All CMS\ninformation systems and major applications are covered by a security plan,\nwhich is compliant with current CMS procedures.\n\n    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include\nPHI):\n\n    The SSP is necessary for the information system to be authorized. As the\nsecurity controls section of a privacy impact assessment or other privacy\ndocumentation may not provide sufficient details to determine which controls\nhave been implemented, the SSP and plan of action and milestones (POA&M, see\nPM-4) are the best locations to address privacy related security controls.\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag nist: ['PL-2']\n  tag nist_family: 'Planning'\n  tag cms_ars_type: 'Mandatory'\n  tag cms_ars_baseline: ['High', 'Moderate', 'Low']\n  tag cms_ars_assurance: 'Assurance'\n  tag cms_ars_priority: 'P1'\n  tag cms_ars_reference_policy: \" E-Government Act of 2002 (Pub.

While the ideal is for all the code\nwithin the security function isolation boundary to only contain\nsecurity-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include non-security\nfunctions within the isolation boundary as an exception.\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag nist: ['SC-3']\n  tag nist_family: 'System and Communications Protection'\n  tag cms_ars_type: 'Mandatory'\n  tag cms_ars_baseline: ['High']\n  tag cms_ars_assurance: 'Assurance'\n  tag cms_ars_priority: 'P1'\n  tag cms_ars_reference_policy: ' FISCAM: AC-4, AS-2'\n  tag related_controls: ['AC-3', 'AC-6', 'SA-4', 'SA-5', 'SA-8', 'SA-13',\n'SC-2', 'SC-7', 'SC-39']\n\n  describe \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\" do\n    skip \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\"\n  end\nend\n","source_location":{"line":3,"ref":"cms-ars-3.1-manual-controls-baseline-main/controls/CMS-ARS-3.1-SC-03.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[{"status":"skipped","code_desc":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","run_time":3.8e-06,"start_time":"2021-03-15T16:27:06-04:00","resource":"","skip_message":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","resource_class":"Object","resource_params":"[]"}],"attestation":{"control_id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-SC-03","explanation":"","frequency":"daily","status":"passed","updated":"2021-01-01","updated_by":""}},{"id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-SC-04","title":"Information in Shared Resources ","desc":"Control:\n    The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information\ntransfer via shared system resources.","descriptions":[{"label":"default","data":"Control:\n    The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information\ntransfer via shared system resources."},{"label":"check","data":"Assessment Objective:\n    Determine if the organization has implemented all elements of this control\nas described in the control statements and implementation standard(s).\n\n    Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\n    Determine if:(i) The information system prevents unauthorized and\nunintended information transfer via shared system resources; and(ii) The\norganization meets all the requirements specified in the applicable\nImplementation Standard(s).\n\n    Assessment Methods and Objects:\n    Examine: System and communications protection policy; procedures addressing\ninformation remnants; information system design documentation; information\nsystem configuration settings and associated documentation; other relevant\ndocuments or records.Test: Information system for unauthorized and unintended\ntransfer of information via shared system resources.\n\n    Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\n    Examine: System and communications protection policy; procedures addressing\ninformation remnants; information system design documentation; information\nsystem configuration settings and associated documentation; and other relevant\ndocuments or records.Examine: Information system implement functionality that\nprevents unauthorized and unintended information transfers via shared system\nresources.Test: Information system for unauthorized and unintended transfer of\ninformation via shared system resources."},{"label":"fix","data":"Implementation Standards:\n    High & Moderate:\n\n    Std.1 - Ensure that users of shared system resources cannot intentionally\nor unintentionally access information remnants, including encrypted\nrepresentations of information, produced by the actions of a prior user or\nsystem process acting on behalf of a prior user.

The organization privacy incident and breach response\ncapability must be able to demonstrate knowledge of the privacy incident and\nbreach response processes and procedures and evidence showing the plan is\nfollowed routinely while responding to privacy incidents and breaches.In\ncontrast to the Incident Response (IR) family in NIST 800-53 Appendix F, which\nconcerns a broader range of incidents affecting information security, this\ncontrol uses the term Privacy Incident to describe only those incidents that\nrelate to personally identifiable information (PII). The organization Privacy\nIncident Response Plan is developed under the leadership of the Senior Official\nfor Privacy (SOP). The plan includes: (i) The establishment of a\ncross-functional Privacy Incident Response Team that reviews, approves, and\nparticipates in the execution of the Privacy Incident Response Plan; (ii) A\nprocess to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected\nindividuals is appropriate and to provide that notice accordingly; (iii) A\nprivacy risk assessment process to determine the extent of harm, embarrassment,\ninconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals and, where appropriate, to\ntake steps to mitigate any such risks; (iv) Internal procedures to ensure\nprompt reporting by employees and contractors of any privacy incident to the\nSOP and other designated officials consistent with organizational incident\nmanagement structures; and (v) Internal procedures for reporting noncompliance\nwith organizational privacy policy by employees or contractors to appropriate\nmanagement or oversight officials. Some organizations may be required by law or\npolicy to provide notice to oversight organizations in the event of a\nbreach.Organizations may also choose to integrate Privacy Incident Response\nPlans with Security Incident Response Plans or keep the plans separate.The Best\nJudgment Standard, explained in OMB M-17-12, Footnote 6, imposes a requirement\nfor organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for privacy\nbreaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. The Best\nJudgment Standard gives organizations responsibility for their own data in two\nimportant ways. First, the organization must determine the sensitivity of its\nPII, based on the information and the context in which the information appears.\nSecond, the organization must determine whether a privacy breach should be\nreported, based on the resultant privacy risk to the organization and to\naffected individuals. The Best Judgment Standard effectively imposes a\nrequirement on organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for\nprivacy breaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. In the\ncontext of breach reporting, the purpose of the Best Judgment Standard is to\nlimit reporting to those privacy breaches which meet the\norganization's risk threshold. Conversely, under the Best Judgment\nStandard, organizations are not required to report privacy breaches that do not\nmeet their risk threshold.

The organization privacy incident and breach response\ncapability must be able to demonstrate knowledge of the privacy incident and\nbreach response processes and procedures and evidence showing the plan is\nfollowed routinely while responding to privacy incidents and breaches.In\ncontrast to the Incident Response (IR) family in NIST 800-53 Appendix F, which\nconcerns a broader range of incidents affecting information security, this\ncontrol uses the term Privacy Incident to describe only those incidents that\nrelate to personally identifiable information (PII). The organization Privacy\nIncident Response Plan is developed under the leadership of the Senior Official\nfor Privacy (SOP). The plan includes: (i) The establishment of a\ncross-functional Privacy Incident Response Team that reviews, approves, and\nparticipates in the execution of the Privacy Incident Response Plan; (ii) A\nprocess to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected\nindividuals is appropriate and to provide that notice accordingly; (iii) A\nprivacy risk assessment process to determine the extent of harm, embarrassment,\ninconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals and, where appropriate, to\ntake steps to mitigate any such risks; (iv) Internal procedures to ensure\nprompt reporting by employees and contractors of any privacy incident to the\nSOP and other designated officials consistent with organizational incident\nmanagement structures; and (v) Internal procedures for reporting noncompliance\nwith organizational privacy policy by employees or contractors to appropriate\nmanagement or oversight officials. Some organizations may be required by law or\npolicy to provide notice to oversight organizations in the event of a\nbreach.Organizations may also choose to integrate Privacy Incident Response\nPlans with Security Incident Response Plans or keep the plans separate.The Best\nJudgment Standard, explained in OMB M-17-12, Footnote 6, imposes a requirement\nfor organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for privacy\nbreaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. The Best\nJudgment Standard gives organizations responsibility for their own data in two\nimportant ways. First, the organization must determine the sensitivity of its\nPII, based on the information and the context in which the information appears.\nSecond, the organization must determine whether a privacy breach should be\nreported, based on the resultant privacy risk to the organization and to\naffected individuals. The Best Judgment Standard effectively imposes a\nrequirement on organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for\nprivacy breaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. In the\ncontext of breach reporting, the purpose of the Best Judgment Standard is to\nlimit reporting to those privacy breaches which meet the\norganization's risk threshold. Conversely, under the Best Judgment\nStandard, organizations are not required to report privacy breaches that do not\nmeet their risk threshold. The policy provides an example of implementing the\nBest Judgment Standard as discarding a document with the author's\nname on the front and no other PII into an office trashcan, positing that this\nprobably would fall below and organization's risk threshold and\nwould not need to be reported. OMB M-17-12 does not provide bright line rules\nto define what is considered 'sensitive PII' using the\ncommon dictionary definition approach to the language in the\nmemorandum-and under what circumstances a privacy breach should be\nreported, both because it would be a futile effort to attempt to delineate or\npredict the myriad potential contexts and situations, and agencies are in the\nbest position to know and understand the relevant circumstances of their PII to\ndetermine which PII is sensitive and which breaches create risk.\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag nist: ['SE-2']\n  tag nist_family: 'Security'\n  tag cms_ars_type: 'Mandatory'\n  tag cms_ars_baseline: ['High', 'Moderate', 'Low']\n  tag cms_ars_assurance: nil\n  tag cms_ars_priority: 'P1'\n  tag cms_ars_reference_policy: \" CFR: 45 C.F.R.

Protected health information (PHI) must be handled\nand retained in accordance with the HIPAA Security Rule as it has specific\nrequirements for information handling and record retention.\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag nist: ['SI-12']\n  tag nist_family: 'System and Information Integrity'\n  tag cms_ars_type: 'Mandatory'\n  tag cms_ars_baseline: ['High', 'Moderate', 'Low']\n  tag cms_ars_assurance: nil\n  tag cms_ars_priority: 'P2'\n  tag cms_ars_reference_policy: \" Code: U.S.C. §552a(e)(4); FedRAMP Rev.\n4 Baseline; FISCAM: BP-3; 44 U.S.C. §3301, 45 C.F.R.\n§164.316(b)(1)(ii); 45 C.F.R. §164.316(b)(2)(i)\"\n  tag related_controls: ['AC-16', 'AU-5', 'AU-11', 'MP-2', 'MP-4', 'AP-2',\n'DM-2', 'TR-2']\n\n  describe \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\" do\n    skip \"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control\"\n  end\nend\n","source_location":{"line":3,"ref":"cms-ars-3.1-manual-controls-baseline-main/controls/CMS-ARS-3.1-SI-12.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[{"status":"skipped","code_desc":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","run_time":3.8e-06,"start_time":"2021-03-15T16:27:06-04:00","resource":"","skip_message":"A manual review/attestation is required to address interview/examine assessment objectives for this control","resource_class":"Object","resource_params":"[]"}],"attestation":{"control_id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-SI-12","explanation":"","frequency":"daily","status":"passed","updated":"2021-01-01","updated_by":""}},{"id":"CMS-ARS-3.1-SI-16","title":"Memory Protection ","desc":"Control:\n    The information system implements security safeguards (e.g., data execution\nprevention, address space layout randomization) to protect its memory from\nunauthorized code execution.
